= Lesson 3: Reaching For The Clouds (Cloud Foundry)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can push a Spring Boot application to Cloud Foundry. You
will need a https://run.pivotal.io/[Cloud Foundry account] and the
http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/[`cf` command line tool] installed.

You can also get a Lite (free) account from IBM. Detailed instructions available at:
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-getting-started

== Pushing to Cloud Foundry
You can build and push the application as follows:

[source]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push ll-cf-demo -p .\target\livelessons-cloud-cloudfoundry-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 256M
