= Lesson 3: Reaching For The Clouds (Consume Cloud Services using Environment Variables)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can bind services from you cloud provider to Spring using
environment variables. Here we are using Cloud Foundry but similar principles can be
used for any cloud provider.

== Prerequisites
You will need a https://run.pivotal.io/[Cloud Foundry account] and the
http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/[`cf` command line tool] installed. You
will also need to create two services named `ll-car-sql-database` and
`ll-car-sql-database2` using the following commands:

[source]
----
$ cf create-service elephantsql turtle ll-car-sql-database
$ cf create-service elephantsql turtle ll-car-sql-database2
----

NOTE: Cloud Foundry is clever enough to automatically wire a single datasource into your
application. We create and bind two databases to prevent this auto-reconfiguration to
show how environment variables can be used. See link:manifest.yml[manifest.yml] for
the binding details.

== Pushing the application to Cloud Foundry
To push the application type:

[source]
----
$ cf push andregs-ll-cc
----

== Understanding the application
The link:src/main/resources/application.yml[`application.yml`] defines a
database URL that references the environment variable:

[source]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${cloud.services.ll-car-sql-database.connection.jdbcurl}
----

We also need to ensure that pooling is not enabled since the free Database tier doesn't
allow multiple connections:

[source]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    tomcat:
      max-active: 1
----

You can also browse to `/actuator/env` endpoint to inspect the environment variables,
including the ones with connection information to our bound services.
