= Lesson 4: Working With Data (Relational Database with JPA)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can access a classic relational database using Spring Data
and JPA.

== Building and running the sample
Use the following commands to build run the application:

[source]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/livelessons-data-jpa-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Understanding the code
This demo uses an embedded database to store data. The `Car` class provides the basic
entity and the `CarRepository` interface provides access. Notice that the
`findByMakeIgnoringCase` method is all that is needed to create the OQL query.

When the application starts mock data is added and then a single query is executed.
JPA can be heavyweight. Now compare what we did in this app with the same
functionality via classic JDBC in link:../livelessons-data-jdbc/[livelessons-data-jdbc]
